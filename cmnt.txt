start and sub There are 18 (for the NL and pre-DH AL) or 20 (for the AL with the DH) start records, which identify the starting lineups for the game. Each start or sub record has five fields. The sub records are used when a player is replaced during a game. The roster files that accompany the event files include throwing and batting handedness information.

1. The first field is the Retrosheet player id, which is unique for each player.

2. The second field is the player's name.

3. The next field is either 0 (for visiting team), or 1 (for home team).

4. The next field is the position in the batting order, 1 - 9. When a game is played using the DH rule the pitcher is given the batting order position 0.

5. The last field is the fielding position. The numbers are in the standard notation, with designated hitters being identified as position 10. On sub records 11 indicates a pinch hitter and 12 is used for a pinch runner.
