play The play records contain the events of the game. Each play record has 7 fields.

1. The first field is the inning, an integer starting at 1.

2. The second field is either 0 (for visiting team) or 1 (for home team).

3. The third field is the Retrosheet player id of the player at the plate.

4. The fourth field is the count on the batter when this particular event (play) occurred. Most Retrosheet games do not have this information, and in such cases, "??" appears in this field.

5. The fifth field is of variable length and contains all pitches to this batter in this plate appearance and is described below. If pitches are unknown, this field is left empty, nothing is between the commas.

6. The sixth field describes the play or event that occurred.
